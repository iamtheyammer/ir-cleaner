# ir-cleaner
A simple python script to clean IR codes so that they work better. Basically, it just rounds your numbers.

## Usage
1. Download the script. There's a little clone/download button on the homepage for this repository, so click that and download ZIP.
2. Run the script, in pretty much any python compiler. (Open, then F5 in IDLE, or on a mac `python3 ./IRCleaner.py`)
3. Enjoy your cleaned code!
